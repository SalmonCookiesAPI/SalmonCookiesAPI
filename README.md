# Salmon Cookies API
Simulated corporate store sales analytics.

## Usage

This site is an exercise creating an API to return data for Store Locations posted to the API by users. The analyzed data utilized from each store is:
- Location Name
- Minimum Customers per Hour
- Maximum customers per Hour
- Average Cookies per Sale

Our API stores this data, and will simulate a days sales by hour upon request.

## Setup

This site is meant to be used as an API, with requests made by a seperate site. However, with the implementation of Swagger, the user can test making requests to the API, including getting, posting, updating and deleting locations (all standard CRUD operations).
